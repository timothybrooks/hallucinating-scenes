We introduce the Humans in Context dataset in our work. The dataset is sourced from 10 existing research datasets, heavily filtered to contain 19M frames of humans in everyday environments, and supplemented with pose labels obtained using OpenPose.

We release a subset of the Humans in Context dataset available for direct download here. The entire dataset cannot be released directly due to licensing limitatons of the source datasets, however, below are instructions to download all of the 10 source datasets and construct the full Humans in Context meta-dataset we use in our paper.

Here are the 10 source datasets:
- Holistic Video Understanding (HVU) dataset.
- Moments in Time dataset.
- Kinetics (700-2020) dataset.
- Charades dataset.
- InstaVariety dataset.
- Oops dataset.
- MPII dataset.
- VLOG dataset.
- PennAction dataset
- YouTube-VOS dataset
